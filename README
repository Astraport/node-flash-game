This is a simple Node.js/Flash front-end multi-user game.
I'm still learning the ropes of Node and plan on making much cooler things in the future.
This was created as an example for a http://flashcodersny.com meeting.
There are things that don't work in this example and things that should be done better but it give you an idea. All of this was put together in a few hours. Credit should go to Keith Peters for the space ship class.
